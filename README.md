# ORC

**Orchestrator** — a behavior-tree workflow execution engine built on [Grain](https://github.com/ObneyAI/grain).

ORC provides composable primitives for building, executing, optimizing, and evaluating LLM-powered workflows. It's designed as a library that consumers pull in as a git dependency.

![ORC workflows are behavior trees — and any tree can be composed as a subbehavior inside a bigger one](docs/images/bt-compose-delegate.svg)

*An ORC workflow **is** a behavior tree. Composites (`sequence`, `fallback`, `parallel`, `map-each`) shape control flow; leaves (`llm`, `code`, `condition`, `repl-researcher`) do the work — and any whole tree can be dropped into a bigger one as a subbehavior via `:delegate`. That's the entire mental model.*

> **Early-stage software.** ORC is under active development. Expect sharp edges and breaking changes — APIs, event schemas, and conventions may shift between commits. Pin to a specific `:git/sha` and review the diff before updating. Expect incomplete docs, use at your own peril!

## New here?

Start with **[docs/GETTING-STARTED.md](docs/GETTING-STARTED.md)** — a progressive contract-analysis walkthrough from bare behavior tree through judges, GEPA, ontology, and self-improvement.

## Pick your package

ORC ships as standalone packages — **you pull in exactly ONE package and it
bundles every component that capability needs** (transitively). You don't
assemble components by hand. Find the row that matches what you want, then add
one dependency: give it the lib name shown and point `:deps/root` at the project.

| I want… | Pull this package | Heavy deps |
|---|---|:--:|
| Just run behavior trees (the engine) | `obneyai/orc-service` → `projects/orc-service` | — |
| …plus LLM-as-judge evaluation | `obneyai/orc-evaluation` → `projects/orc-evaluation` | — |
| …plus GEPA prompt optimization | `obneyai/orc-gepa` → `projects/orc-gepa` | — |
| …plus concept graph + DJL embeddings | `obneyai/orc-ontology` → `projects/orc-ontology` | DJL (JVM) |
| …plus ColBERT retrieval (added to ontology) | also `obneyai/orc-colbert` → `projects/orc-colbert` | Python |
| …plus MCP-driven tree generation | `obneyai/orc-mcp-sheet-builder` → `projects/orc-mcp-sheet-builder` | — |
| **Everything** / the full self-improving loop | `obneyai/orc` → `projects/orc` | DJL + Python |

```clojure
;; deps.edn — pick ONE row above; use its lib name + :deps/root
obneyai/orc-evaluation {:git/url "https://github.com/ObneyAI/orc.git"
                        :git/sha "..."                    ;; pin to a reviewed commit
                        :deps/root "projects/orc-evaluation"}
```

Every non-leaf package bundles the engine (`orc-service`) transitively, so the
require namespaces are the same whichever you pick. The only time you add a
*second* package is ColBERT (pull `orc-ontology` **and** `orc-colbert` — distinct
lib names so the keys don't collide). Full per-package detail and the
ontology+colbert combination live in **[docs/PACKAGES.md](docs/PACKAGES.md)**; the
layer → internal-component mapping and dependency graph live in
**[docs/COMPONENT-MAP.md](docs/COMPONENT-MAP.md)**.

> **Self-improving loop is alpha-stage.** The full loop (`:auto-classify?` +
> `:recursive?`) works end-to-end on workflows that align with the shipped seed
> corpus, but force-fit classifications appear on out-of-distribution tasks. It
> needs the ColBERT Python bridge. See [docs/SELF-IMPROVING-LOOP.md](docs/SELF-IMPROVING-LOOP.md)
> for an honest current-state breakdown.

> **RLM recursive mode is now the default.** `:repl-researcher` nodes default to
> `{:rlm {:recursive? true}}`; terminal mode (`:rlm true` / `:rlm {:recursive? false}`)
> is deprecated and will be removed.

## Quick Start

Add the package you picked above to your `deps.edn`. The umbrella (`obneyai/orc`
→ `projects/orc`) gives you everything to start experimenting; swap it for a
leaner package (e.g. `obneyai/orc-service`) once you know which layers you need:

```clojure
obneyai/orc {:git/url "https://github.com/ObneyAI/orc.git"
             :git/sha "..."
             :deps/root "projects/orc"}
```

```clojure
(require '[ai.obney.orc.orc-service.interface :as orc])

;; Define a workflow using the DSL
(def my-workflow
  (orc/workflow "summarizer"
    (orc/blackboard
      {:input   :string
       :summary :string})
    (orc/sequence "main"
      (orc/llm "summarize"
        :instruction "Summarize the input text in 2 sentences."
        :reads [:input]
        :writes [:summary]))))

;; Build it (idempotent — no-op if definition hasn't changed)
(orc/build-workflow! ctx my-workflow)

;; Execute it
(orc/execute ctx sheet-id {:input "Long article text..."})
;; => {:status :success, :outputs {:summary "..."}, :duration-ms 1234}
```

## Components

The full opt-in layer table, dependency graph, and known issues live in **[docs/COMPONENT-MAP.md](docs/COMPONENT-MAP.md)**. For judge architecture, rubric design, and custom judge patterns see **[docs/JUDGE-ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/JUDGE-ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

| Component | Namespace | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **orc-service** | `ai.obney.orc.orc-service` | Core behavior tree execution, DSL, versioning, event sourcing |
| **gepa** | `ai.obney.orc.gepa` | LLM instruction optimization with Pareto frontier selection |
| **evaluation** | `ai.obney.orc.evaluation` | LLM-as-judge evaluation (grounding, reasoning, completeness) |
| **colbert** | `ai.obney.orc.colbert` | Late-interaction retrieval via Python ColBERT bridge |
| **ontology** | `ai.obney.orc.ontology` | Three-layer concept graph with embeddings and pattern discovery |
| **mcp-sheet-builder** | `ai.obney.orc.mcp-sheet-builder` | Dynamic workflow generation from MCP tool schemas |
| **langfuse** | `ai.obney.orc.langfuse` | Observability and tracing integration |

## Architecture

ORC is built on the **Grain** event-sourcing framework (CQRS pattern):

```
Commands -> Events -> Read Models -> Queries
               |
               v
         Todo Processors (side effects)
```

- **Sheets** are behavior trees stored as event streams
- **Nodes** are composable: `sequence`, `fallback`, `parallel`, `map-each`, `llm`, `code`, `condition`, `repl-researcher`
- **Execution** dispatches through the command processor, runs asynchronously via todo processors, and delivers results through a completion registry
- **Versioning** supports draft/published modes with stash/restore
- **The DSL** provides a declarative API for building workflows without touching events directly

### Execution Flow

```
1. orc/execute dispatches :sheet/tick-tree command
2. Command creates execution snapshot (isolated blackboard)
3. Event triggers todo processor (async)
4. Processor walks the behavior tree:
   - sequence: run children in order, fail on first failure
   - fallback: run children in order, succeed on first success
   - parallel: run children concurrently
   - llm: call LLM via DSCloj
   - code: evaluate Clojure via SCI
   - repl-researcher: iterative code generation + MCP tool calling
5. Result delivered via completion promise
```

### Optimization Loop (GEPA)

```
1. Define metric functions (exact-match, contains, judge-based)
2. Start optimization with training examples
3. GEPA proposes instruction variants
4. Evaluates candidates against metrics
5. Pareto frontier selection (multi-objective)
6. Repeat until budget exhausted
```

## Node Types

| Node | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `orc/sequence` | Composite | Run children in order. Fails on first failure. |
| `orc/fallback` | Composite | Run children in order. Succeeds on first success. |
| `orc/parallel` | Composite | Run all children concurrently. |
| `orc/map-each` | Composite | Map a subtree over a collection input. |
| `orc/llm` | Leaf | Call an LLM with instruction + inputs -> outputs. |
| `orc/code` | Leaf | Execute Clojure code (SCI sandbox). |
| `orc/condition` | Leaf | Branch based on code predicate. |
| `orc/llm-condition` | Leaf | Branch based on LLM yes/no judgment. |
| `orc/repl-researcher` | Leaf | Iterative: generate code, call MCP tools, refine. |
| `orc/delegate` | Leaf | Execute another workflow with isolated blackboard. |

These compose into real control flow. A `fallback` with a `condition` is if/else; an `llm-condition` inside a `fallback` is LLM-driven routing:

![A fallback with a condition gives if/else branching](docs/images/bt-fallback-condition.svg)

![An llm-condition inside a fallback routes on an LLM yes/no judgment](docs/images/bt-llm-routing.svg)

And the flagship leaf, `repl-researcher`, is a whole two-phase reasoning loop that drops into a tree like any other node — see the [RLM Guide](docs/RLM-GUIDE.md):

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Java 21+** (with module access for LMDB)
- **Clojure CLI** (`brew install clojure/tools/clojure`)
- **Python 3.10+** (optional, for ColBERT semantic search)

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone
git clone git@github.com:ObneyAI/orc.git && cd orc

# Start nREPL (includes JVM flags for LMDB)
./scripts/nrepl.sh
```

### Running Tests

```bash
clj -M:poly test                     # changed bricks only
clj -M:poly test :all-bricks         # all bricks
clj -M:poly test brick:orc-service   # specific brick
```

### ColBERT Setup (Optional)

ColBERT provides late-interaction semantic retrieval. It requires a separate Python environment:

```bash
./scripts/setup-colbert.sh
```

This creates `.venv-colbert/` with RAGatouille, PyTorch, and sentence-transformers. The Clojure `colbert` component communicates with Python via `scripts/colbert_bridge.py` (subprocess JSON-RPC).

## Consumer Requirements

ORC is a library — consumers provide:

- **Grain infrastructure**: event store (in-memory or Postgres), LMDB cache, control plane
- **LLM provider**: DSCloj configuration (`:dscloj-provider` in context)
- **Optional**: Langfuse client for tracing, MCP servers for tool calling, Python for ColBERT
