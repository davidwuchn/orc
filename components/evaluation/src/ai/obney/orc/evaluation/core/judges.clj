  "Judge implementations for evaluating LLM node executions.

   Judges are functions that take trace data and return evaluation results.
   They can be used directly or wrapped in ORC sheets for full observability.

   CONFIGURATION:
   Set *use-mock-llm* to true for testing without LLM calls.
   Set *judge-provider* to configure which LLM provider to use.
