(ns ai.obney.orc.evaluation.core.sheets
  "ORC Sheet definitions for running evaluation workflows.

   This namespace provides pre-built evaluation sheets that leverage
   the full ORC/Grain infrastructure for tracing and observability.

   ## Usage

   ```clojure
   (require '[ai.obney.orc.evaluation.core.sheets :as eval-sheets])
   (require '[ai.obney.orc.orc-service.interface :as sheet])

   ;; Build the evaluation suite (idempotent)
   (def suite-id (sheet/build-workflow! ctx (eval-sheets/evaluation-suite)))

   ;; Execute on a trace
   (sheet/execute ctx suite-id {\"trace-data\" {...}})
   ```

   ## Available Sheets

   - `grounding-judge-sheet` - Single judge for grounding/hallucination
   - `instruction-judge-sheet` - Single judge for instruction following
   - `reasoning-judge-sheet` - Single judge for reasoning quality
   - `completeness-judge-sheet` - Single judge for completeness
   - `evaluation-suite` - Full multi-dimension evaluation with aggregation"
