;; Gap-7 RED#6 — RLM repl-researcher dispatch populates :completion-kind by status
;; =============================================================================
;;
;; The orc-service todo processor that executes a repl-researcher
;; dispatches :sheet/complete-node-execution at the end of each Phase 1
;; iteration. In recursive RLM mode, status is :tree-generated for
;; intermediate iterations (where the model emit-tree!'d) and :success
;; for the terminal (final!) call. The dispatch must tag those
;; completion events with the appropriate :completion-kind so the judge
;; runtime routes correctly.
;;
;; This test isn't a full RLM execution (that needs the real executor +
;; an LLM). Instead it dispatches the command directly with both
;; status flavors and asserts the events carry the right
;; :completion-kind. The dispatch-site change (which the GREEN
;; implementation makes) is to populate the field at every callsite
;; based on the status.
;;
;; Note: this test ONLY locks the wiring between status and
;; completion-kind at the orc-service command level. The LIVE verify
;; exercises the full recursive-RLM path.
