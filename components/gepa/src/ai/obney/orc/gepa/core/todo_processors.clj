  "Todo processors for GEPA optimization loop.

   These event handlers implement the core optimization algorithm with
   subsample-first evaluation (Python GEPA parity):

   1. On optimization-started: Create seed candidate
   2. On candidate-created: Trigger full evaluation (for seed/inherited)
   3. On candidate-evaluated: Update frontier, check budget
   4. On frontier-updated: Propose mutation → create candidate
   5. On mutation-proposed: Evaluate on SUBSAMPLE (3 examples)
   6. On subsample-evaluated:
      - If improved (new_sum > old_sum): Trigger FULL evaluation
      - If not improved: Propose another mutation
   7. Loop until budget exhausted, then complete

   This subsample-first approach matches Python GEPA's efficiency:
   - Rejected candidates cost only 3 metric calls (vs 72 for full valset)
   - Accepted candidates cost 3 + 72 = 75 metric calls
   - Net savings: ~60% if 50% rejection rate

   Each processor is triggered by events and emits commands
   to drive the state machine forward."
