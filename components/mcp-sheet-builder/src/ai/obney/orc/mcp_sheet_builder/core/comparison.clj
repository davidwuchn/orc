  "Comparison framework for evaluating Phase 1 vs Phase 2 approaches.

   Phase 1: Simple LLM + code workflows (deterministic)
   Phase 2: repl-researcher with iterative LLM+SCI (adaptive)

   - Side-by-side execution of two workflows
   - Metrics collection (latency, tokens, accuracy)
   - Batch comparison across multiple test cases
   - Summary statistics and winner determination"
