(ns ai.obney.orc.mcp-sheet-builder.core.intent-analyzer
  "Analyze user intent to inform intelligent sheet building.

   Phase 2 of Intent-Based Sheet Building.

   This module uses an LLM to understand what the user wants to accomplish,
   producing structured intent data that informs:
   - Tool relevance scoring (which tools matter for this goal)
   - Pattern selection (which workflow pattern fits the intent)
   - Node instructions (goal-oriented, not generic)"
