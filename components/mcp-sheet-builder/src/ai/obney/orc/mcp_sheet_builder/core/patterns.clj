3. PARALLEL-FAN-OUT: Use when multiple independent operations can run together
4. HIERARCHICAL-DECOMPOSITION: Use when task can be broken into subtasks
5. GENERATOR-CRITIC: Use when one tool creates and another validates
6. ITERATIVE-REFINEMENT: Use for progressive improvement loops
7. RESEARCH-COMPILATION: Use when gathering from multiple sources then synthesizing
8. ADVERSARIAL: Use when comparing alternatives or needing balanced analysis

Choose based on:

- How the tools relate to each other (sequential, parallel, refinement)
- Tool capabilities (search, generate, validate, etc.)
