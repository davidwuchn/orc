  "Tool relevance scoring for large MCP servers (50+ tools).

   Phase 5 of Intent-Based Sheet Building.

   This module helps users navigate large tool sets by:
   - Scoring each tool's relevance to user intent
   - Suggesting top N tools for the workflow
   - Allowing user overrides (include/exclude specific tools)

   Key principle: This is ASSISTANCE, not restriction.
   - User sees ALL tools with relevance scores
   - System SUGGESTS which to use
   - User can override with :include-tools / :exclude-tools"
