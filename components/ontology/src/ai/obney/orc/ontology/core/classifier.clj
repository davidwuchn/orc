  "Evaluation classifier - maps evaluation dimensions to failure ontology URIs.

   The evaluation component produces scores across 4 dimensions:
   - Grounding: Is output supported by input context?
   - Instruction Following: Did it follow given instructions?
   - Reasoning: Is the logic sound?
   - Completeness: Is anything missing?

   This classifier maps low scores to specific failure URIs and attempts
   to identify more specific subtypes based on feedback text analysis."
