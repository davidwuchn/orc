      and tests that want a consolidation regardless of counter state.

   2. Threshold-driven (:on-demand? false / unset) — uses Grain CAS to
      enforce exactly-once-per-threshold-crossing semantics:

         * Reads the target's lifetime :total source-event count and
           configured threshold from read-models.
         * Derives crossing-number = (quot total threshold) — stable
           across all concurrent handlers within the same threshold
           window of source events.
         * Tags the event with [:crossing <stable-uuid-from-crossing>]
           and CAS-guards on that tag being absent. The first concurrent
           handler's append succeeds; subsequent handlers' appends get
           ::anom/conflict and emit no event.

      This survives burst-event races where N processor handlers all
      observe delta >= threshold before any prior reset has propagated
      to projections — only the first handler's CAS predicate evaluates
      true at append time inside the event store."
