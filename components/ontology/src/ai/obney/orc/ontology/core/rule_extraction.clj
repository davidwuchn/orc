(ns ai.obney.orc.ontology.core.rule-extraction
  "Domain-agnostic rule extraction from successful episodes.

   Analyzes tree-strength-recorded events with rich context to extract
   condition-action rules that can be injected into future LLM prompts.

   Works with ANY domain - drones, legal, sales, construction, etc.
   Domain-specific interpretation happens via the LLM prompt.

   Key insight: Instead of storing abstract pattern labels like 'PrecisionHover',
   we extract explicit rules like:
     When: [domain conditions met]
     Action: [domain-specific action]
     Evidence: Episodes 3, 7, 12 (success rate: 92%)

   Integration:
   - Reads :ontology/tree-strength-recorded events with context-conditions
   - Uses LLM to extract condition-action patterns for any domain
   - Emits :ontology/learned-rule-extracted events"

Your task is to identify CONDITION-ACTION patterns that led to success in this domain.

- Expected outcome (what the episode was trying to achieve)
- Episode conditions (domain-specific state at decision time)
- Actions taken (what actions led to success)
- Condition summaries (min/max/avg values for numeric conditions)

For each outcome group with 2+ episodes, extract rules in this JSON format:

{
  \"condition_description\": \"When [human-readable condition description]\",
  \"conditions\": {
    \"field_name\": [\"operator\", value],  // e.g., [\">\", 0.2], [\"<\", 100], [\"between\", 10, 50]

  },
  \"confidence\": 0.92,
  \"success_rate\": 0.95,
  \"evidence_count\": 5,
  \"expected_outcome\": \"outcome_name\"

Rules should be:

2. ACTIONABLE - Describe what action to take, not just what to avoid
3. DOMAIN-APPROPRIATE - Use terminology fitting the domain context
4. EVIDENCED - Based on actual successful episodes
