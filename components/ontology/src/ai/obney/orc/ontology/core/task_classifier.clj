  "C-2c-1 + C-2d-2 + R05b: pure classify-task and classify-behaviors functions.

   Wraps `ontology/search-descriptions` with reranker-driven intent
   to assign a tree-class UUID to a task signature. Pure over strings —
   the caller (C-2c-2's executor wedge) handles all upstream lookup
   (sheet → fingerprint → parent-summary) and downstream command
   dispatch.

   C-2d-2 extends classify-task with an optional walk-down phase: when
   top-1 fitness is below :specificity-threshold (default 0.9) AND the
   matched node has children in the tree-class concept graph, the
   classifier descends into the children, picking the one that best
   fits the task. The walk terminates at a confident-enough leaf, an
   un-fittable level (returns the deepest matched ancestor or mints a
   fresh leaf, see below), or a hard depth cap of 5.

   R05b adds classify-behaviors: parallel pure fn that queries the
   Layer-2 behavioral-subtree corpus. Returns top-N few-shot example
   candidates with reasoning; the model decides reuse/adapt/mint.
   When :structural-context is provided, candidates are narrowed via
   behavior:composes-into edges in the concept graph (retrieval hints,
   not gates — empty filter falls back to unfiltered set).

   Distinct from `core/classifier.clj` which is the evaluation-dimension
   classifier (maps low judge scores to failure URIs); this namespace
   is the TASK classifier (maps task signatures to tree-class UUIDs)."

(defn classify-behaviors
  "R05b: pure behavioral classification. Given a task signature +
   threshold (+ optional :structural-context + :top-n), returns the
   top-N behavioral-subtree examples from the R05a Layer-2 corpus.

   The corpus is FEW-SHOT EXAMPLE MATERIAL for the recursive RLM
   researcher, NOT a routing taxonomy. classify-behaviors returns
   top-N candidates with reasoning + recommended-pattern snippets;
   the model reasons over them and decides reuse/adapt/mint.

   Args:
     ctx  — context with :event-store / :tenant-id / etc. (passed
            through to search-descriptions)
     opts — {:task-signature :threshold :structural-context :top-n}
       :task-signature      — required string. Caller-built static-config
                              text (same shape classify-task receives).
       :threshold           — required double in [0.0, 1.0]. Candidates
                              below this drop out of the result.
       :structural-context  — optional UUID. The structural tree-class
                              already assigned to this task (typically
                              the :assigned-tree-id from a prior
                              classify-task call). When provided, the
                              candidate set is narrowed via the
                              behavior:composes-into graph to behaviors
                              that compose into this shell. RETRIEVAL
                              HINT — when the narrowed set is empty
                              (no Layer-2 behaviors compose into this
                              shell yet), the result FALLS BACK to the
                              unfiltered candidate set so the model
                              still sees relevant examples.
       :top-n               — optional int. Maximum number of behavioral
                              candidates to return above threshold.
                              Defaults to 3.

   Returns:
     {:behaviors        [{:behavior-id <uuid>
                          :confidence <0.0-1.0>
                          :was-fresh-mint? <bool>
                          :reasoning <string>
                          :rerank-source <:reranker | :colbert-fallback>}
                         ...]
      :rerank-fallback? <bool>}

   When NO candidate passes :threshold, :behaviors carries exactly one
   fresh-mint marker with :was-fresh-mint? true + a fresh UUID +
   reasoning string. Per R01: :rerank-fallback? is derived from top-1's
   :rerank-source (true when :colbert-fallback)."
