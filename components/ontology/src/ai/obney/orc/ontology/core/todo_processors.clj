  "Todo processors for ontology self-learning.

   These event handlers implement the automatic feedback loop between
   evaluation and ontology:

   1. On evaluation/trace-evaluated: Classify failures and auto-record to tree profile
   2. On tree-profile-updated (future): Trigger re-embedding for hybrid search
   3. C-2a-3a — threshold-tracking trigger: when a target's delta-counter
      crosses its configured threshold, emit :ontology/request-consolidation
      so the consolidator processor (C-2a-3b) can run reflection.

   This closes the integration gap where judges evaluate outputs but
   results don't flow to the ontology for learning."
