  "Public API for the ontology component.

   Three-layer ontology system:
   1. Failure Ontology - Why things go wrong (maps to 4 evaluation judges)
   2. Success Ontology - What makes things work (structural, instruction, data flow patterns)
   3. Problem Ontology - What types of problems exist (classification, retrieval, generation)

   Main capabilities:
   - Static ontology initialization from predefined concepts
   - Event-sourced concept graph with relationships
   - Tree profile tracking (strengths, weaknesses, problem mappings)
   - Node-type pattern learning aggregation
   - Evaluation classification to failure URIs
   - TTL/SKOS/OWL serialization for graph database export
   - Embedding generation and semantic search (Phase 4)
   - Hybrid search combining graph BFS + embeddings via RRF"
