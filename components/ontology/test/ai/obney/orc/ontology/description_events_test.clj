  "Tests for C-2a-1's new description event types + commands + read-model.

   Three new event types — one per granularity:
     :ontology/node-type-description-updated
     :ontology/node-instance-description-updated
     :ontology/tree-description-updated

   Three new commands (1:1 with events, following the
   record-tree-strength/record-tree-weakness idiom):
     :ontology/record-node-type-description
     :ontology/record-node-instance-description
     :ontology/record-tree-description

   All three event types share a common body shape (description-body)
   carrying principle-shaped strengths/weaknesses, capabilities,
   representative-uses, summary, version, and consolidated-from-event-count
   fields."
