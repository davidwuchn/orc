  "EL-1b (ADR 0015, emergence loop): convergence-capture — bundle the :novel
   candidate by multi-signal similarity + evidence-gate retrieval.

   Two deterministic surfaces, both exercised via with-redefs on
   search-descriptions (and the consolidation-total resolver) so the tests
   cover ONLY the bundle decision + the gate filter — not LLM output.

   PART 1 — bundle the :novel candidate.
     On the confident no-match (:novel) path, before scattering a fresh
     random-uuid, classify-task probes the retrieved :tree-class candidates
     with a multi-signal fusion (reranker fitness + ColBERT score, RRF-fused)
     and, if the best :tree-class candidate's absolute fitness sits in the
     BUNDLE band [bundle-threshold, threshold), assigns to THAT class
     (converge — :was-fresh-mint? false, :bundled? true) instead of minting a
     fresh uuid. Below the bundle band -> mint fresh (unchanged). A distinct
     candidate (low fit) must NOT over-merge.

   PART 2 — evidence-gate retrieval.
     A :tree-class candidate is only retrievable once its consolidation total
     clears the SEPARATE retrieval gate (default conservative). A one-off
     (total < gate) is filtered OUT of candidates; a recurring class
     (total >= gate) surfaces. PROVEN: the same class flips from filtered to
     surfaced once its total crosses the gate.

   :tree-fingerprint candidates are NOT gated (only the instruction-aware
   :tree-class axis the emergence loop accrues on)."
