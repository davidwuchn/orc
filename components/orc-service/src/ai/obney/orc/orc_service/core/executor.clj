(ns ai.obney.orc.orc-service.core.executor
  "DSCloj-based executor for behavior tree leaf nodes.

   This module bridges the gap between the behavior tree's leaf nodes
   and DSCloj's AI execution capabilities.

   Supports multiple executor types:
   - :ai - DSCloj AI execution with optional model selection
   - :code - Clojure function execution
   - :tool - Direct tool invocation (future)
   - :repl-researcher - Iterative LLM+SCI code execution

   Mapping:
   - Node instruction → DSCloj module instructions
   - Node reads + blackboard types → DSCloj module inputs
   - Node writes + blackboard types → DSCloj module outputs
   - Blackboard values → DSCloj input values
   - DSCloj output values → Blackboard writes"
