  "Execute RLM-generated behavior trees via child ORC ticks.

   This module implements Phase 2 of the RLM two-phase execution:
   1. Phase 1: RLM generates a behavior tree via emit-tree!
   2. Phase 2: This module executes the tree via a child ORC tick

   The executor:
   - Takes canonical ORC DSL (output of rlm-dsl->orc-dsl)
   - Writes sandbox variables to blackboard
   - Spawns an ephemeral child sheet with the tree as root
   - Returns results via promise for the parent to await

   This follows the delegate node pattern but is specialized for
   inline tree execution rather than referencing an existing sheet."
