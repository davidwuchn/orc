  "Execute RLM-generated behavior trees via child ORC ticks.

   This module implements Phase 2 of the RLM two-phase execution:
   1. Phase 1: RLM generates a behavior tree via emit-tree!
   2. Phase 2: This module executes the tree via a child ORC tick

   The executor:
   - Takes canonical ORC DSL (output of rlm-dsl->orc-dsl)
   - Writes sandbox variables to blackboard
   - Spawns an ephemeral child sheet with the tree as root
   - Returns results via promise for the parent to await

   This follows the delegate node pattern but is specialized for
   inline tree execution rather than referencing an existing sheet."

(defn execute-tree
  "Execute a canonical ORC DSL tree via child tick.

   Arguments:
   - tree: Canonical ORC DSL (output of rlm-dsl->orc-dsl)
   - context: Execution context with event-store, cache, etc.
   - options: Map with:
     - :sandbox-vars - Variables from Phase 1 to write to blackboard
     - :blackboard - Additional blackboard inputs
     - :timeout-ms - Execution timeout (default 60000)

   Returns:
   {:status :success/:failure/:timeout
    :outputs {...}
    :usage {...}
    :duration-ms N}

   U6 options:
     :blackboard-schemas - Optional {key schema} map preserving parent
                           schemas (e.g. [:string {:field-type :image}])
