   Returns a vector of selected per-event fields, sorted by timestamp.
   The shape mirrors what bench harnesses (predict_rlm_comparison, R-Inject)
   used to query themselves — it's now a first-class part of the tick
   completion result so consumers don't have to compose it.

   Each entry:
     {:node-id <uuid> :sheet-id <uuid> :tick-id <uuid> :status <kw>
      :timestamp <OffsetDateTime>
      :inputs {…optional…} :writes {…optional…}
      :usage {…optional…} :duration-ms <ms optional>}

   When events of that type haven't been emitted (or event-store is nil),
   returns an empty vector. Never throws."

;; RLM Rolling Judge — RETIRED in Gap-2
;; =============================================================================
;;
;; The standalone `:rlm evaluate-rlm-tree` processor (heuristic-only
;; structural eval of model-generated trees) is no longer here. Its
;; functionality moved to the unified evaluator protocol:
;;
;;   - Heuristic re-extracted to:
;;     `components/evaluation/src/.../core/heuristic_structural.clj`
;;   - Wired as the `:heuristic-structural` judge type in:
;;     `components/evaluation/src/.../core/judge_runtime.clj`
;;   - Consumers attach it via `:sheet/set-node-judges` to specific
;;     leaf nodes. The judge fires when the host node's :writes carry
;;     a `:generated-tree-raw` entry — what a repl-researcher's Phase 1
;;     emit-tree! produces.
;;
;; The `:rlm/tree-evaluated` event TYPE remains in the schema registry
;; for backward compatibility with any external consumer, but no code
;; in this repo emits it. New evaluations land as `:judge/score-emitted`
;; events with `:judge-name "<consumer-chosen-name>"` and
;; `:judge-config {:type :heuristic-structural}`.
