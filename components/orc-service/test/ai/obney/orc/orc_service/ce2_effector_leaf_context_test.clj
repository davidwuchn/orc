  "CE-2 durable tests — engine leaf effector reachability (ADR 0018).

   Two engine gaps, proven through the REAL execute-tree / :sheet/tick-tree /
   execute-leaf-node / execute-code path with a mock provider + real Grain
   (in-memory event store, schema-validated commands -> events -> projections):

     G1  An OPAQUE :tool-context threaded from the RLM execution context
         (execute-tree's context arg) reaches the Phase-2 :code leaf fn's
         execution context — across the async command -> event -> processor
         boundary, at any tree depth, and transitively into nested ticks.
     G2  The :available-code-nodes VALUE reaches the RLM code-gen inputs map
         handed to the model (declared field + catalog prompt note non-empty).

   Discipline: assertions read the leaf's received context / stub-tool record
   BACK (never a node return value). :tool-context / the gated tool are STUB
   INSTRUMENTS; the engine threading is the system under test."
