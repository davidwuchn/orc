(ns ai.obney.orc.orc-service.end-to-end-integration-test
  "End-to-end integration test exercising all major ORC features in a
   single cohesive scenario: a customer support triage pipeline.

   Covers: DSL workflow building, all node types (sequence, parallel, fallback,
   condition, map-each, code, llm), blackboard, execution, versioning, judges,
   evaluation, ontology classification, GEPA optimization primitives,
   export/import, rolling metrics, and tracing.

   Uses REAL LLM calls via OpenRouter — gated behind ORC_INTEGRATION_TESTS=true.

   Collects structured report data in `*report*` atom for post-run analysis."
