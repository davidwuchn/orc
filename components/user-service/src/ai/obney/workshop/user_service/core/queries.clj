(ns ai.obney.workshop.user-service.core.queries
  "The core queries namespace in a grain service component implements
     the query handlers and defines the query registry. Query functions
     take a context that includes any necessary dependencies, to be injected
     in the base for the service. Usually a query-request-handler or another
     type of adapter will call the query processor, which will access the query
     registry for the entire application in the context. Queries either return a cognitect
     anomaly or a map that optionally has a :query/result which is some
     data that is meant to be returned to the caller, see query-request-handler for example."
