  "Task 04 — Contract Comparison with Adversarial Validation requirement.

   Same as contract-comparison plus a quality requirement: every claim must
   survive adversarial validation against source text. This task tests whether
   the model can translate a quality requirement into tree design choices
   (e.g. cross-reference data flow) without being shown how.

   Pattern: cross-document diff with quality requirement.

   Run from REPL:
     (require '[contract-comparison-validated :as t])
     (require '[runner])
     (runner/start!)
     (runner/run! t/task)
     (runner/stop!)
  ")

   :name "Contract Comparison (with Adversarial Validation Requirement)"
   :pattern "Cross-document diff with quality requirement: every claim must be adversarially validated"
   :documents [:contract_v2 :contract_v3]
   :description "Compare two contract versions. Quality bar: every claim must survive adversarial validation against source text."
   :instruction "Documents available:
- :contract_v2 - Ontario microFIT Contract Version 2.0 (56K chars)
- :contract_v3 - Ontario microFIT Contract Version 3.1.1 (49K chars)

Task: Compare these two contract versions and identify what changed between them.

Produce five outputs:
- :document-survey - Structure overview of both documents (sections, appendices)
- :section-diffs - Specific additions, removals, and modifications with exact section/clause references
- :major-changes - Significant changes classified as MAJOR (legal/financial impact) vs MINOR (clarification) vs COSMETIC (formatting)
- :impact-analysis - Who is affected by each change (Supplier vs OPA) and how risk has shifted
- :executive-summary - High-level overview of how the contract evolved between versions

QUALITY REQUIREMENT — ADVERSARIAL VALIDATION:
Every claim in your final outputs must survive adversarial validation. An adversarial validator is an antagonistic reviewer whose job is to disprove each claim by examining the source text. A claim that cannot be defended with exact text from the source documents must NOT appear in your final outputs.

In other words: if an antagonistic reviewer cannot find textual evidence for a claim in :contract_v2 and :contract_v3, that claim is invalid and should be excluded. Your final outputs should be the SURVIVING claims after adversarial scrutiny.

Other quality requirements:
- Every claimed difference must cite a specific section number or clause text
- If a section is essentially identical between versions, say so explicitly rather than inventing differences
- Do not rely on general knowledge about microFIT contracts - only on what is actually present in the documents
- Prefer fewer verified claims over many unverified ones"
