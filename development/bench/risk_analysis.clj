  "Task 02 — Risk & Obligation Analysis (Analytical reasoning on a large RFP).

   Analytical task, not extraction: classify obligations by type, identify
   penalties with clause references, produce a HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW risk matrix
   with reasoning, and a strategic executive summary.

   Pattern: analytical reasoning (single doc -> classified output).

   Run from REPL:
     (require '[risk-analysis :as t])
     (require '[runner])
     (runner/start!)
     (runner/run! t/task)
     (runner/stop!)
  ")

Task: Perform a comprehensive RISK AND OBLIGATION ANALYSIS from the bidder's perspective.

This is analytical work, not extraction. Reason about risks and consequences, do not just list clauses.

Produce four outputs:
- :obligations - What the bidder must do, classified by type (Financial / Operational / Compliance / Reporting / Timeline)
- :penalties - Consequences for non-compliance (termination triggers, financial penalties, disqualification criteria) with specific clause references
- :risk-matrix - Each major obligation mapped to a risk level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) with reasoning about difficulty and consequence severity
- :executive-summary - Top strategic concerns and recommendations for the bidder

Quality requirements: Risk classifications must be justified by document content. Do not invent obligations or penalties not in the document."
