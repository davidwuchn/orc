  "C-Loop-4 LIVE verify — :nil-writes flows end-to-end through real OpenRouter.

   Question this verify answers: when a tree returns :status :success but
   some declared writes came back nil/empty, does the model on the NEXT
   iteration actually SEE the :nil-writes signal in its iter-2 prompt
   AND react to it (acknowledge or recover)?

   Approach:
     1. Hand-construct a sandbox-vars-map containing a :tree-results entry
        with :status :success + :nil-writes [:obligations :penalties].
        This simulates the post-iter-1 state of the risk-analysis broken-
        aggregator case from the C-Loop-4 spec.
     2. Build the iter-2 dscloj module via build-rlm-code-generation-module
        (the same fn the recursive RLM loop calls).
     3. Call dscloj/predict with REAL OpenRouter (gemini-3-flash-preview)
        and the synthetic sandbox state.
     4. Verify the model's :reasoning string acknowledges the nil-writes
        gap OR the model's :code chooses to recover (re-extract from
        surviving sandbox vars, design a smaller resume tree, or terminate
        with explicit acknowledgment that nil was the correct answer).

   What this does NOT prove:
     - That the model self-recovers PERFECTLY on iter-2. The acceptance test
       per spec is: 'the model SEES the signal and has a basis for its
       decision', NOT 'model always recovers'.
     - The full 2-iteration loop with a deliberately-broken aggregator.
       That's a downstream behavioral test; this verify proves the SIGNAL
       LANDS and the model can read it.

   PASS criteria:
     - Real OpenRouter call returns successfully
     - Model's :reasoning OR :code references nil-writes / nil / empty /
       missing semantics
     - OR model chooses recovery action (re-extracts from sandbox vars,
       emits smaller tree, or terminates with honest acknowledgment)
